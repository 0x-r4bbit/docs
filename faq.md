### Which browsers does toolkitchen support?
Toolkitchen aims to support [evergreen browsers](http://www.yetihq.com/blog/evergreen-web-browser/). After all, we're trying to simulate the future, and as someone once said, "You're headed for trouble if all you do is stare in the rear-view mirror." In practice, this means we support the most recent versions of Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, and Firefox. Some pieces of toolkitchen may support more browsers if it doesn't require too much extra effort.

### What's up with the name toolkitchen?
It's just the first thing we came up with. We're not necessarily huge fans of it, and it will likely change at some point in the future.
