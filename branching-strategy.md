title: Branching Workflow

{{site.project_title}} repositories maintain **stable** versions on the _master_ branch and **development** versions on the _dev_ branch.

_master_: stable  
_dev_: development (bleeding edge)


<p class="alert">
If there is no <em>dev</em> branch on a particular repository, then there is no
"stable branch"; all work in that repository is bleeding edge.
</p>
