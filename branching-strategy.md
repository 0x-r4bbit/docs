## Toolkitchen Branching Workflow

Toolkitchen repositories maintain **stable** versions on the _master_ branch and **development** versions on the _dev_ branch.

_master_: stable  
_dev_: development (bleeding edge)

If there is no _dev_ branch on a particular repository, then there is no stable branch; all work in that repository is bleeding edge.
