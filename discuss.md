We've got a number of ways to stay in touch.

* For quick questions, you can find us on IRC in the **#polymer** freenode channel.
* To stay entirely in the loop, join (and participate in!) the relatively high-traffic [polymer-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/polymer-dev) Google group.
* If that's too much information, subscribe to the [polymer-announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/polymer-announce) Google group for just the interesting announcements.
